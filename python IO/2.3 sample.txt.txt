In many ways I'll miss the good old days
Someday
Someday

It hurts to say but I want you to stay
Sometimes
Sometimes

When we was young, oh man did we have fun
Always
Always

Promises they break before they're made
Sometimes
Sometimes

My ex says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you want to stand by my side
Darling your heads not right

I say alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah I think ill be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometimes

Someday
Now I ain't wasting no more time

Trying, trying

And now my fears they come to me in threes
So I
Sometimes
They fade, my friend, you say the strangest things
I find

Sometimes
Oh my ex says I'm lacking in depth
Still I will try my best
You say you want to stand by my side

Darling your heads not right
I say alone we stand together we fall apart
Yeah I think ill be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard

Tables they turn sometimes
Oh someday
I ain't wasting no more time

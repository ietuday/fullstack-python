# 
# A **for** loop acts as an iterator in Python, it goes through items that are in a *sequence* or any other 
# iterable item. Objects that we've learned about that we can iterate over include strings,lists,tuples, 
# and even built in iterables for dictionaries, such as the keys or values.
# 
# We've already seen the **for** statement a little bit in past lectures but now lets formalize our understanding.
# 
# Here's the general format for a **for** loop in Python:
# 
#     for item in object:
#         statements to do stuff
#     

# The variable name used for the item is completely up to the coder, so use your best 
# judgment for choosing a name that makes sense and you will be able to understand when 
# revisiting your code. This item name can then be referenced inside you loop, for example
#  if you wanted to use if statements to perform checks.
# 
# Let's go ahead and work through several example of **for** loops using a variety of
#  data object types. we'll start simple and build more complexity later on.
# 
# ##Example 1
# Iterating through a list.

# In[1]:


# We'll learn how to automate this sort of list in the next lecture
l = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


# In[2]:


for num in l:
    print(num)


# Great! Hopefully this makes sense. Now lets add a if statement to check
#  for even numbers. We'll first introduce a new concept here--the modulo.
# ### Modulo
# The modulo allows us to get the remainder in a division and uses the % 
# symbol. For example:

# In[5]:


17 % 5


# This makes sense since 17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2. Let's see a few more quick examples:

# In[6]:


# 3 Remainder 1
10 % 3


# In[9]:


# 2 Remainder 4
18 % 7


# In[10]:


# 2 no remainder
4 % 2


# Notice that if a number is fully divisible with no remainder, 
# the result of the modulo call is 0. We can use this to test for even numbers, 
# since if a number modulo 2 is equal to 0, that means it is an even number!
# 
# Back to the **for** loops!
# 
# ##Example 2
# Let's print only the even numbers from that list!

# In[11]:


for num in l:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)


# We could have also put in else statement in there:

# In[12]:


for num in l:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print (num)
    else:
        print('Odd number')


# ## Example 3
# Another common idea during a **for** loop is keeping some sort of 
# running tally during the multiple loops. For example, lets create a for loop that sums up the list:

# In[13]:


# Start sum at zero
list_sum = 0 

for num in l:
    list_sum = list_sum + num

print(list_sum)


# Great! Read over the above cell and make sure you understand
#  fully what is going on. Also we could have implemented a += to to the addition towards the sum. For example:

# In[14]:


# Start sum at zero
list_sum = 0 

for num in l:
    list_sum += num

print(list_sum)


# ## Example 4
# We've used for loops with lists, how about with strings?
#  Remember strings are a sequence so when we iterate through 
# them we will be accessing each item in that string.

# In[15]:


for letter in 'This is a string.':
    print(letter)


# ##Example 5
# Let's now look at how a for loop can be used with a tuple:

# In[16]:


tup = (1,2,3,4,5)

for t in tup:
    print(t)


# ## Example 6
# Tuples have a special quality when it comes to **for** loops.
#  If you are iterating through a sequence that contains tuples,
#  the item can actually be the tuple itself, this is an example 
# of *tuple unpacking*. During the **for** loop we will be unpacking
#  the tuple inside of a sequence and we can access the individual
#  items inside that tuple!

# In[17]:


l = [(2,4),(6,8),(10,12)]


# In[18]:


for tup in l:
    print (tup)


# In[19]:


# Now with unpacking!
for (t1,t2) in l:
    print (t1)


# Cool! With tuples in a sequence we can access the 
# items inside of them through unpacking! The reason this is important is
#  because many object will deliver their iterables through
#  tuples. Let's start exploring iterating through Dictionaries to explore this further!

# ##Example 7

# In[1]:


d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}


# In[2]:


for item in d:
    print (item)


# Notice how this produces only the keys. So how can we get the values? Or both the keys and the values? 
# 
# Here is where we are going to have a Python 3 Alert!
# ### <font color='red'>Python 3 Alert!</font>
# 
# ### Python 2: Use .iteritems() to iterate through
# 
# In Python 2 you should use .iteritems() to iterate through the 
# keys and values of a dictionary. This basically creates a generator
#  (we will get into generators later on in the course) that will generate
#  the keys and values of your dictionary. Let's see it in action:

# In[9]:


# Creates a generator
d.iteritems()


# Calling the items() method returns a list of tuples. Now we can iterate through them just as we did in the previous examples.

# In[10]:


# Create a generator
for k,v in d.iteritems():
    print(k)
    print(v)  


# ### Python 3: items()
# In Python 3 you should use .items() to iterate through the keys and values of a dictionary. For example:

# In[11]:


# For Python 3
for k,v in d.items():
    print(k)
    print(v)  


# You might be wondering why this worked in Python 2. This is because 
# of the introduction of generators to Python during its earlier years. (We will go over 
# generators and what they are in a future section, but the basic notion is that generators 
# don't store data in memory, but instead just yield it to you as it goes through an iterable item).
# 
# Originally, Python items() built a real list of tuples and returned t
# hat. That could potentially take a lot of extra memory.
# 
# Then, generators were introduced to the language in general, and that method was
#  reimplemented as an iterator-generator method named iteritems(). The original remains for backwards compatibility.
# 
# One of Python 3â€™s changes is that  items() now return iterators, and a list is never 
# fully built. The iteritems() method is also gone, since items() now works like iteritems() in Python 2.
# 

# ## Conclusion
# 
# We've learned how to use for loops to iterate through tuples,lists,strings,
#  and dictionaries. It will be an important tool for us, so make sure you know it well 
# and understood the above examples.
